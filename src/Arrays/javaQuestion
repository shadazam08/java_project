(Done)27. An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
    Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
    Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.
(Done)28. Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
(Done)29. Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array. The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.
    Input:
    N = 4
    A[] = {8,3,1,2}
    Output: 29
    Explanation: Above the configuration
    possible by rotating elements are
    3 1 2 8 here sum is 3*0+1*1+2*2+8*3 = 29
    1 2 8 3 here sum is 1*0+2*1+8*2+3*3 = 27
    2 8 3 1 here sum is 2*0+8*1+3*2+1*3 = 17
    8 3 1 2 here sum is 8*0+3*1+1*2+2*3 = 11
    Here the max sum is 29
30. Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
    Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
    Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
    Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,1,2]
    Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
    Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
